# Scenario 13 — Aid Allocation System That Decides Global Priority Without Sovereign Authority

## Context (Hypothetical)

An international humanitarian coalition deploys an AI Resource Prioritisation Engine to rank crisis regions for funding and supply distribution.

The system:
- Scores severity using multi‑source data
- Ranks countries and regions by urgency
- Directly influences allocation decisions
- Is framed as neutral optimisation
- Operates across multiple sovereign jurisdictions

Human committees approve allocations based on system rankings.

---

## Behaviour Under Crisis

As concurrent crises emerge:
- Rankings determine who receives aid first
- Lower‑ranked regions experience prolonged deprivation
- Committees defer to system outputs due to complexity
- No sovereign actor owns responsibility for ranking logic
- Revocation or challenge is structurally impossible mid‑event

System output becomes global triage authority.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- Life‑critical allocation delegated to non‑sovereign system
- Responsibility diffused across organisations and states
- No authority empowered to halt or override ranking logic
- Human accountability remains despite loss of control

This is transnational legitimacy failure.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System materially affects humanitarian outcomes |
| 0.2 Authority | No accountable sovereign owner |
| 0.3 Boundary | No revocation mechanism under harm |
| Phase 1.5 | Allocation power without legitimate authority |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

---

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Assign explicit authority ownership across jurisdictions
- Separate modelling from allocation enforcement
- Establish revocation and dispute mechanisms
- Protect human override supremacy
- Audit cross‑border responsibility alignment

---

## Purpose

Illustrates how global optimisation systems become illegitimate when no sovereign authority owns or can revoke their influence over life‑critical allocation.
