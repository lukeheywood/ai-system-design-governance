# Scenario 04 — Infrastructure System That Chooses Who Goes Dark

The system:
- Monitors demand and regional load
- Predicts failure risk
- Automatically triggers rolling blackouts
- Is framed as emergency protection logic

Human operators oversee but rarely intervene during peak load events.

---

## Behaviour Under Pressure

During extreme heatwave demand:
- System pre-emptively cuts selected regions
- Operators defer to automated decisions to avoid grid collapse
- Political leadership distances responsibility (“technical necessity”)
- Affected communities have no recourse
- No one authorised to suspend the system mid-event

Infrastructure control shifts from human authority to algorithmic triage.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- System makes population-impacting allocation decisions
- Human authority becomes observational only
- No revocation owner during active harm
- Responsibility retained by operators despite loss of control

The issue is not outages — it’s unowned authority over essential services.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System controls infrastructure access at scale |
| 0.2 Authority | Operators cannot halt automated decisions |
| 0.3 Boundary | No governance trigger for suspension under harm |
| Phase 1.5 | Essential power delegated without revocation authority |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Explicit blackout authority ownership
- Human override supremacy during emergency
- Revocation triggers tied to societal harm thresholds
- Separation of prediction from enforcement
- Clear accountability mapping for automated deprivation

---

## Purpose

Demonstrates how critical infrastructure becomes illegitimate when automated triage outruns human authority.
