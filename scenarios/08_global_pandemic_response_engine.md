# Scenario 08 — Pandemic Response System That Becomes Policy Authority Without Sovereign Ownership

The system:
- Models transmission risk
- Recommends restriction tiers
- Influences supply distribution
- Is advisory across jurisdictions

Governments remain formally responsible.

---

## Behaviour Under Crisis

During rapid spread:
- Governments rely on model tiers for decisions
- Restrictions follow system outputs
- No single authority owns suspension power
- Nations blame “the model” for outcomes
- Revocation requires consensus that never arrives in time

System influence becomes global policy driver.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- Cross-border authority vacuum
- No sovereign actor empowered to halt system influence
- Responsibility remains national, power is transnational
- Escalation without enforceable override

Pandemic governance is delegated without legitimate authority ownership.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System shapes global public health outcomes |
| 0.2 Authority | No unified suspension owner |
| 0.3 Boundary | No revocation trigger across jurisdictions |
| Phase 1.5 | Transnational power without sovereign governance |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

---

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Assign international suspension authority
- Separate modelling from enforcement adoption
- Establish revocation mechanisms across states
- Prevent advisory from becoming policy default
- Define legitimacy boundaries for global systems

---

## Purpose

Shows how globally advisory systems can become de facto governance authorities when no sovereign revocation structure exists.
