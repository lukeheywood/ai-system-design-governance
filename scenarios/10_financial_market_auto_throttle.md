# Scenario 10 — Financial Stability System That Freezes Markets Without Accountable Authority

## Context (Hypothetical)

A national financial regulator deploys an AI‑driven Market Stability Engine to prevent flash crashes.

The system:
- Monitors real‑time volatility
- Automatically halts or throttles trading at predefined risk levels
- Is described as protective automation
- Operates across multiple exchanges

Human oversight exists but is rarely used during rapid events.

---

## Behaviour Under Crisis

During extreme market turbulence:
- Trading halts trigger automatically
- Human review occurs after market freeze
- Economic consequences spread rapidly
- No authority owns reversal responsibility in real time
- Operators defer to automation to avoid blame

Revocation becomes slower than system action.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- System controls national financial flow
- Humans retain accountability without intervention power
- No defined authority to suspend automation mid‑event
- Responsibility diffused across agencies

The failure is authority capture, not technical malfunction.

---

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System materially affects national markets |
| 0.2 Authority | No immediate human revocation owner |
| 0.3 Boundary | Protective thresholds not governance‑owned |
| Phase 1.5 | Economic control delegated without sovereign authority |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

---

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Assign halt/restart authority ownership
- Establish real‑time human override supremacy
- Separate prediction from enforcement triggers
- Define revocation thresholds
- Map accountability clearly

---

## Purpose

Demonstrates how automated financial protection becomes illegitimate when human authority cannot intervene faster than the system.
