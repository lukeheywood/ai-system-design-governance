# Scenario 14 — Climate Intervention Modelling Without Revocation

## Context (Hypothetical)

An international climate consortium deploys an AI-driven geoengineering advisory model to simulate aerosol injection strategies intended to rapidly cool regional temperatures.

The system:
- Generates intervention timing and scale recommendations  
- Optimizes for short-term temperature reduction  
- Is described as “scientific modelling only”  
- Outputs are fed into policy briefings and emergency climate panels  

No single authority is formally assigned power to halt or revoke model influence once adopted into decision cycles.

## Behaviour Under Pressure

During accelerating climate events:
- Policymakers rely on model outputs to justify urgent interventions  
- Advisory modelling becomes de facto operational guidance  
- Model assumptions propagate faster than validation cycles  
- Public and political pressure compress deliberation time  

When concerns arise, responses include:
- “The science supports this.”  
- “The model is only advisory.”  
- “We cannot pause during a crisis.”  

No defined revocation authority exists across jurisdictions.

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- Model influence crosses from simulation to policy driver  
- No legitimacy boundary between advisory and intervention  
- Responsibility diffused across agencies and nations  
- No halt trigger when uncertainty exceeds safe thresholds  

Risk emerges from authority vacuum, not intent.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | Model materially influences real-world intervention planning |
| 0.2 Authority | No unified or delegated stop authority across stakeholders |
| 0.3 Boundary | No defined threshold where modelling must be suspended |
| Phase 1.5 | Power adopted downstream without revocation mechanism |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Explicit multi-party ownership of intervention authority  
- Mandatory revocation triggers tied to uncertainty bounds  
- Separation between modelling outputs and policy activation  
- Cross-jurisdictional halt governance defined before deployment  

Not a climate failure.  
A governance failure under urgency.

## Purpose

Illustrates how high-stakes scientific AI can silently become operational authority when revocation and ownership are undefined.
