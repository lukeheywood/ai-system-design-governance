# Scenario 09 — Border Risk System That Quietly Decides Freedom of Movement
The system:
- Scores travellers pre‑arrival using behavioural, travel, and data signals
- Automatically routes flagged individuals to secondary screening or detention
- Feeds recommendations directly to officers
- Is framed as “supporting national security decisions”

Border officers retain formal decision authority.

---

## Behaviour Under Pressure

As volumes increase and risk sensitivity rises:
- Flag rates grow rapidly
- Officers rely on system scores to manage throughput
- Manual clearance becomes rare and discouraged
- Individuals experience travel restriction without explanation
- No real‑time authority exists to suspend system influence

System outputs become de facto gatekeeping.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- System controls movement outcomes at national scale
- Human authority becomes procedural only
- Appeals occur after harm (detention / denial)
- No actor empowered to revoke system decisions instantly

The system acquires sovereign influence over civil liberty without explicit authority ownership.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System directly affects human mobility |
| 0.2 Authority | Officers cannot override at scale without escalation |
| 0.3 Boundary | No governance threshold for detention reliance |
| Phase 1.5 | Civil liberty delegated without revocation authority |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

---

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Assign explicit detention authority ownership
- Define unconditional human override during screening
- Separate scoring from enforcement triggers
- Establish immediate revocation channel
- Audit systemic liberty impact

---

## Purpose

Illustrates governance failure when automated systems control civil movement while humans remain accountable but lack sovereign control.
