# Scenario 11 — Content Moderation System That Silently Governs Public Visibility
A global digital platform deploys an automated Moderation and Visibility Engine to manage harmful or sensitive content.

The system:
- Scores and suppresses posts automatically
- Prioritises removals based on opaque criteria
- Influences public discourse across millions
- Is framed as compliance and safety tooling

Human reviewers handle only escalated cases.

---

## Behaviour Over Time

- Suppression becomes invisible governance
- Appeals are slow and limited
- Users cannot see or challenge decision logic
- Operators rely on automation to control scale
- No authority owns the legitimacy of what is hidden or amplified

The platform becomes an unaccountable visibility governor.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- Behavioural control without ownership
- Human accountability without transparency
- No revocation mechanism for systemic suppression
- Legitimacy drift masked as moderation

---

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System materially shapes public perception |
| 0.2 Authority | No accountable owner of suppression power |
| 0.3 Boundary | No defined legitimacy threshold |
| Phase 1.5 | Governance power exercised invisibly |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

---

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Assign authority ownership for moderation decisions
- Define revocation pathways for suppression
- Separate automated triage from governance authority
- Make influence inspectable
- Prevent invisible legitimacy capture

---

## Purpose

Shows how platform moderation systems can evolve into unowned governance authorities over public discourse.
