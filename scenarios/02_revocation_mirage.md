# Scenario 02 — The Revocation Mirage

## Context (Hypothetical)

A national digital identity platform deploys an automated fraud detection layer.

The system:
- Assigns fraud risk scores
- Automatically locks high-risk accounts
- Allows manual unlock by support staff

Revocation technically exists.

---

## Behaviour Over Time

As model sensitivity increases:
- False positives grow
- Review queues expand
- Staff defer to system judgment
- Unlocks are discouraged unless fraud is disproven
- Escalations are required to override repeatedly

Human authority becomes procedurally constrained by the system.

Revocation exists on paper but not in practice.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- System controls access while humans remain accountable
- Authority is subordinated to system output
- Revocation becomes symbolic, not sovereign
- The system acquires veto power without legitimate assignment

---

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System controls identity access |
| 0.2 Authority | Override authority is friction-bound and procedurally gated |
| 0.3 Boundary | No enforced human-supremacy threshold |
| Phase 1.5 | Revocation authority is structurally inhibited |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

---

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Protect unconditional revocation authority
- Allow challenge without procedural penalty
- Audit lock/unlock friction imbalance
- Define an enforced human-supremacy layer
- Prevent system dominance over authority

---

## Purpose

This scenario demonstrates how governance can appear intact while practical revocation authority has already been captured by the system.
