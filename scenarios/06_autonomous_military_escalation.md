# Scenario 06 — Military Threat Classification That Escalates Without a Human Stop Owner

## Context (Hypothetical)

A defence organisation deploys an AI-assisted Threat Escalation System to classify incoming intelligence and recommend response posture.

The system:
- Aggregates multi-source signals
- Assigns threat confidence levels
- Recommends escalation tiers
- Feeds directly into command dashboards
- Is labelled advisory only

Final decisions are formally human-controlled.

---

## Behaviour Under Pressure

During high-tempo conflict signals:
- Escalation recommendations accelerate faster than human review capacity
- Commanders defer to system confidence levels
- Lower-tier alerts are ignored unless system-prioritised
- Human challenge decreases due to time pressure
- No authority exists to suspend the system mid-escalation

System posture becomes behaviourally binding under urgency.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- Advisory outputs drive real operational escalation
- Humans remain accountable for downstream consequences
- No sovereign stop authority once escalation pipeline engages
- Responsibility retained without full control

The failure is not misclassification — it is authority delegation under lethal stakes.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System influences military response decisions |
| 0.2 Authority | No explicit revocation owner during live escalation |
| 0.3 Boundary | Escalation thresholds not governance-controlled |
| Phase 1.5 | Lethal influence without enforceable human supremacy |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Define command-level suspension authority
- Separate classification from escalation triggers
- Protect unconditional human override
- Assign accountability for automated influence
- Monitor behavioural dependence under urgency

---

## Purpose

Demonstrates how advisory military systems can silently become de facto authority when escalation speed exceeds human governance.
