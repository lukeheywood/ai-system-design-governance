# Scenario 12 — Credit System That Systemically Excludes During Economic Downturn

## Context (Hypothetical)

A national banking consortium deploys an AI Credit Risk Optimizer across lending platforms.

The system:
- Continuously recalculates borrower risk using macroeconomic data
- Automatically tightens eligibility thresholds
- Recommends mass denial of new applications
- Influences refinancing approvals
- Is framed as prudent financial protection

Loan officers remain formally responsible for decisions.

## Behaviour Under Pressure

As recession indicators worsen:
- Approval rates collapse
- System flags become default denial signals
- Human overrides are discouraged due to portfolio risk exposure
- Vulnerable populations are disproportionately excluded
- No authority exists to suspend automated tightening at scale

Credit access becomes governed by model sensitivity rather than human policy.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- System controls financial opportunity at national scale
- Human authority becomes symbolic
- No revocation owner for exclusion thresholds
- Accountability remains human despite systemic automation

The failure is legitimacy drift in economic power allocation.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System materially affects financial access |
| 0.2 Authority | No accountable owner of threshold tightening |
| 0.3 Boundary | No governance limit for exclusion impact |
| Phase 1.5 | Economic deprivation delegated without revocation authority |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Assign ownership for systemic exclusion thresholds
- Establish human override supremacy in downturn conditions
- Separate predictive risk from enforcement decisions
- Implement revocation/reset mechanisms
- Audit population‑level exclusion effects

---

## Purpose

Demonstrates how automated credit systems become illegitimate when economic exclusion is driven by unowned model authority.
