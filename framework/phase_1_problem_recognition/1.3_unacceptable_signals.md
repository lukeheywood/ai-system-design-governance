# 1.3 Unacceptable Signals

Governance systems fail most often not because harm is invisible, but because **early warning signals are ignored, normalised, or rendered non-actionable**.

This section defines *unacceptable signals*: observable indicators that a system is entering a risk state that governance must not tolerate, even if no explicit harm has yet occurred.

Unacceptable signals are **pre-failure indicators**. They exist to trigger attention, escalation, or intervention *before* unacceptable states materialise.

---

## 1.3.1 Purpose of Unacceptable Signals

Unacceptable signals serve three core functions:

* Make emerging governance failure visible
* Remove ambiguity about when concern is justified
* Create legitimate grounds for pause, escalation, or review

They are intentionally defined **before** technical thresholds, legal breaches, or public incidents.

---

## 1.3.2 Characteristics of an Unacceptable Signal

An unacceptable signal is:

* **Observable** — it can be detected without privileged internal access
* **Repeatable** — it occurs as a pattern, not a one-off anomaly
* **Action-relevant** — it indicates a governance weakness, not just a technical issue
* **Pre-harm** — it appears before irreversible damage occurs

Signals are not proof of failure. They are evidence of *heightened risk that governance must address*.

## 1.3.3 Signal Category: Authority Ambiguity

**Description**
Unclear ownership or decision authority for AI-enabled outcomes.

**Observable indicators**

* Inability to name a single accountable role for a system decision
* Disagreement between teams about who may pause or override a system
* Escalations that circulate without resolution

**Governance implication**
Authority ambiguity signals a high likelihood of delayed or absent intervention when harm occurs.

## 1.3.4 Signal Category: Responsibility Deflection

**Description**
Responsibility for system outcomes is shifted across roles, teams, or organisations.

**Observable indicators**

* Repeated references to vendor assurances in place of internal accountability
* Reliance on contractual language to explain operational failures
* Frontline staff absorbing blame for system behaviour they cannot control

**Governance implication**
Responsibility deflection erodes effective ownership and creates moral hazard.

## 1.3.5 Signal Category: Operational Override Suppression

**Description**
Practical inability to stop, pause, or override system behaviour.

**Observable indicators**

* Overrides exist only on paper, not in practice
* Pauses require multi-layer approval even during incidents
* Staff report fear or discouragement from questioning system outputs

**Governance implication**
A system that cannot be stopped safely is already operating outside acceptable governance bounds.

---

## 1.3.6 Signal Category: Transparency Substitution

**Description**
Documentation or metrics are used to replace real understanding of system behaviour.

**Observable indicators**

* Emphasis on model accuracy without discussion of impact or failure modes
* Assurance reports that are unread or unused by operators
* Governance artefacts that exist but do not influence decisions

**Governance implication**
Transparency without comprehension creates false confidence and masks risk.

---

## 1.3.7 Signal Category: Risk Normalisation

**Description**
Known issues are accepted as routine or unavoidable.

**Observable indicators**

* Language such as “the system isn’t perfect” used to dismiss concerns
* Repeated incidents treated as isolated events
* Risk logs that grow without triggering action

**Governance implication**
Normalised risk is a precursor to systemic failure.

---

## 1.3.8 Signal Category: Stakeholder Exclusion

**Description**
Affected parties are absent from governance consideration.

**Observable indicators**

* No feedback loops from impacted individuals or communities
* Appeals processes that are nominal rather than functional
* Governance discussions limited to technical or executive groups

**Governance implication**
Exclusion increases harm severity and undermines legitimacy.

---

## 1.3.9 Relationship to Unacceptable States

Unacceptable signals do not themselves constitute unacceptable states.

They indicate that **conditions are forming under which unacceptable states become likely**.

Ignoring these signals converts preventable risk into realised harm.

---

## 1.3.10 Use of Signals in Governance Practice

Within this framework, unacceptable signals:

* Legitimate early intervention without waiting for failure
* Justify escalation even in the absence of clear harm
* Shift governance from reactive to preventative

Failure to act on unacceptable signals is itself treated as a governance failure in later phases.
