# 1.1 Problem Definition

Modern AI governance efforts consistently fail not because of a lack of values, principles, or technical controls, but because they do not begin with a clear definition of the governance problem they are attempting to solve.

This failure is visible across Australian enterprises, public-sector agencies, and global institutions alike, despite differences in regulatory maturity and risk posture.

This framework defines the problem at the system level, in a way that is applicable across enterprise, public-sector, and national contexts.

## 1.1.1 The Core Governance Failure

The core governance failure in AI systems is **the absence of clear, enforceable ownership over system outcomes**.

In most AI-enabled environments:

* Decisions are distributed across humans, software, data, models, and organisations
* Authority is implied rather than explicitly assigned
* Responsibility is diluted across roles, vendors, and abstractions
* When harm occurs, no single actor can clearly state:

  * who owned the decision
  * who had the authority to prevent it
  * who was obligated to intervene

This is not a technical failure.
It is a governance failure.

## 1.1.2 Why Existing Governance Models Fail

Across jurisdictions, most existing governance models were designed for systems with slower feedback loops and clearer human authority boundaries.

Traditional governance models assume:

* Stable systems
* Clear human decision points
* Linear accountability chains
* Post-hoc review as a sufficient control

AI systems violate all of these assumptions.

They introduce:

* Probabilistic behaviour
* Emergent system effects
* Delegated decision-making
* Rapid iteration beyond policy cycles

As a result, governance mechanisms designed for static systems are applied to dynamic ones — and silently fail.

## 1.1.3 The AI-Specific Amplifier

AI does not create new governance problems.
It **amplifies existing ones**.

Specifically, AI systems:

* Accelerate decisions beyond human review capacity
* Obscure causal chains behind statistical abstraction
* Create plausible deniability through model complexity
* Shift power toward system designers while dispersing accountability

This amplification makes governance failures harder to detect and more costly when they surface.

## 1.1.4 Why Values-First Governance Breaks

Most AI governance initiatives begin with values:

* fairness
* transparency
* accountability
* safety

Values are necessary — but insufficient.

Without first defining:

* what the system is
* where authority is allowed to sit
* who must act when things go wrong

values become unenforceable aspirations.

In practice, values-first governance produces:

* policy documents without operational teeth
* ethics boards without authority
* compliance theatre rather than control

## 1.1.5 The Consequence of Undefined Authority

When authority is undefined:

* Systems continue operating in known-risk states
* Responsibility is deferred until after harm occurs
* Organisations default to risk transfer rather than risk ownership
* Workers absorb moral responsibility without formal power
* The public bears downstream consequences

This creates a structural incentive to expand AI capability faster than governance capacity.

## 1.1.6 Scope of the Problem (Enterprise → State)

While legal and regulatory environments differ by jurisdiction, the underlying governance failure is structurally consistent.

This problem exists across scales:

* **Enterprise**: unclear ownership of automated decisions
* **Public sector**: diffusion of accountability across agencies and vendors
* **National**: regulatory lag relative to system deployment
* **Global**: cross-border systems without jurisdictional clarity

Because the problem is structural, it cannot be solved by:

* better models
* better tooling
* better intentions alone

It requires a governance framework that starts with problem recognition before solution design.
