# 5.2 Revocation and Decommissioning

This section defines the conditions and processes for **revoking approval and decommissioning** AI-enabled systems.

Revocation and decommissioning are treated as **normal governance functions**, not exceptional failures.

---

## 5.2.1 Purpose

Revocation and decommissioning exist to:

* Provide a credible exit from system operation
* Prevent continued use when governance conditions are violated
* Contain harm when risk becomes unacceptable
* Uphold the integrity of earlier phase freezes

A system that cannot be shut down safely is not governable.

---

## 5.2.2 Revocation Triggers

Revocation is mandatory when:

* An unacceptable state is entered
* Required human control can no longer be exercised
* Authority or accountability becomes ambiguous
* Monitoring and review identify sustained drift
* Revalidation after change is not completed

Operational value does not justify continued operation under these conditions.

---

## 5.2.3 Authority to Revoke

Revocation authority must:

* Be explicitly assigned
* Be reachable and empowered in practice
* Not be overridden by operational or commercial pressure

Where authority is unclear, revocation must proceed conservatively.

---

## 5.2.4 Decommissioning Requirements

Decommissioning must:

* Safely halt system operation
* Prevent reactivation without full revalidation
* Preserve evidence and logs for accountability
* Address downstream dependencies

Partial shutdown that leaves latent capability is insufficient.

## 5.2.5 Managed Wind-Down

Where immediate shutdown is not feasible:

* A managed wind-down may be used
* Risk must be actively constrained during transition
* Full decommissioning remains the objective

Wind-down must not become indefinite operation.

---

## 5.2.6 Documentation and Accountability

Revocation and decommissioning actions must be documented, including:

* Triggering conditions
* Decisions taken and by whom
* Timing and execution steps
* Residual risks

These records are part of the system’s governance record.

---

## 5.2.7 Public-Sector Context (Australia)

In Australian public-sector deployments:

* Revocation decisions must be lawful and defensible
* Decommissioning must preserve public accountability
* Systems must not continue operating due to sunk cost

Public systems must retain the ability to stop.

---

## 5.2.8 Governance Implication

Revocation is not an admission of failure.

It is evidence that governance is functioning.

Systems that cannot be revoked safely should not be deployed in the first place.
