# 5.1 Monitoring and Review

This section defines the requirements for **ongoing monitoring and review** of AI-enabled systems after deployment.

Monitoring and review exist to ensure that systems **remain within constitutional, architectural, and governance bounds over time**, not to optimise performance or expand capability.

---

## 5.1.1 Purpose

Monitoring and review exist to:

* Detect drift toward unacceptable signals or states
* Confirm that human authority and control remain intact
* Validate that assumptions made during design and testing still hold
* Trigger timely intervention or revocation when required

Monitoring is a governance obligation, not a product optimisation function.

---

## 5.1.2 What Must Be Monitored

At minimum, deployed systems must be monitored for:

* **Unacceptable signals** defined in Phase 1.3
* **Control erosion**, including reduced usability of oversight or intervention interfaces
* **Authority ambiguity**, including unclear decision ownership
* **Operational drift**, where system behaviour diverges from tested scenarios
* **Dependency changes**, including vendor, data, or infrastructure shifts

Absence of monitoring data is treated as a governance failure.

---

## 5.1.3 Review Cadence

Review must occur:

* Continuously for automated signals and alerts
* Periodically through scheduled governance reviews
* Immediately following incidents, near misses, or material changes

Review cadence must reflect system impact and risk, not operational convenience.

---

## 5.1.4 Human Review Responsibilities

Monitoring outputs must be reviewed by humans holding functional roles defined in Phase 2.

Responsibilities include:

* Interpreting signals and trends
* Determining whether boundaries remain intact
* Escalating concerns without waiting for harm

Review must not be delegated solely to automated tooling or vendors.

---

## 5.1.5 Change Detection and Revalidation

Any material change to:

* system scope or use context
* underlying models or data sources
* control or oversight interfaces
* authority or role assignments

requires revalidation against Phases 3 and 4 before continued operation.

Change without revalidation is prohibited.

---

## 5.1.6 Documentation and Evidence

Monitoring and review activities must produce:

* Records of detected signals and trends
* Decisions taken in response
* Rationale for continued operation or escalation

These records form part of the system’s governance trail.

---

## 5.1.7 Public-Sector Context (Australia)

In Australian public-sector deployments:

* Monitoring must support statutory accountability
* Review records must be auditable
* Known risks must not be silently tolerated

Ongoing review underpins public trust.

---

## 5.1.8 Governance Implication

Governance does not end at deployment.

Monitoring and review ensure that systems remain **eligible** to operate, rather than assuming permission persists indefinitely.
