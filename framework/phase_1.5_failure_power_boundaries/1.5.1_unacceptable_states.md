# Phase 1.5 — Unacceptable States

Unacceptable states define the conditions under which an AI-enabled system **must not operate**, regardless of intent, performance metrics, or claimed benefits.

Where unacceptable signals indicate rising risk, unacceptable states mark the point at which continued operation represents a governance failure in itself.

This phase establishes **hard boundaries**. It is intentionally conservative.

---

## 1.5.1 Purpose of Unacceptable States

Unacceptable states exist to:

* Remove discretion at critical risk thresholds
* Prevent harm through enforced non-operation
* Clarify when governance obligation overrides delivery, efficiency, or innovation goals

They are not contingent on public incidents, legal rulings, or proven harm. Their role is preventative.

---

## 1.5.2 Definition

An unacceptable state is reached when **a system continues to operate despite known structural conditions that make responsible oversight, intervention, or accountability impossible or unreliable**.

Once an unacceptable state is reached, remediation must occur *before* further operation.

## 1.5.3 Unacceptable State: Undefined Decision Authority

**Condition**
No single role or body can be clearly identified as having authority to approve, pause, override, or terminate the system’s operation.

**Why this is unacceptable**
Without defined authority, timely intervention cannot occur. Responsibility is deferred until after harm.

---

## 1.5.4 Unacceptable State: Inoperable Human Override

**Condition**
Human override mechanisms exist only nominally, or cannot be exercised safely, quickly, and without penalty.

**Why this is unacceptable**
A system that cannot be stopped is operating outside human governance.

---

## 1.5.5 Unacceptable State: Accountability–Control Mismatch

**Condition**
Individuals or teams are held accountable for outcomes they do not have the authority or technical ability to influence.

**Why this is unacceptable**
This creates moral injury, suppresses escalation, and incentivises silence.

---

## 1.5.6 Unacceptable State: Opaque Decision Impact

**Condition**
System decisions materially affect individuals or communities, but the basis of those decisions cannot be meaningfully explained to operators or affected parties.

**Why this is unacceptable**
Opacity prevents correction, appeal, and trust.

---

## 1.5.7 Unacceptable State: Normalised Known Harm

**Condition**
Repeated adverse outcomes are treated as expected or unavoidable without corrective action.

**Why this is unacceptable**
Normalised harm indicates governance collapse.

---

## 1.5.8 Unacceptable State: Vendor-Controlled Risk Boundaries

**Condition**
Risk thresholds, monitoring, or escalation criteria are defined primarily by vendors rather than the deploying organisation or public authority.

**Why this is unacceptable**
This displaces governance authority outside legitimate accountability structures.

---

## 1.5.9 Relationship to Unacceptable Signals

Unacceptable states are typically preceded by multiple unacceptable signals.

Failure to act on signals allows systems to drift into unacceptable states.

---

## 1.5.10 Governance Obligation

When an unacceptable state is identified:

* Continued operation is no longer justified
* Pause, rollback, or shutdown becomes mandatory
* Responsibility for inaction is itself a governance failure

This obligation applies regardless of system maturity, sunk cost, or political pressure.

---

## 1.5.11 Role Within the Framework

Unacceptable states form the **constitutional boundary** of this governance framework.

They define where governance ends tolerance and begins enforcement.

Later phases may define mechanisms, processes, and remedies — but these boundaries do not move.
