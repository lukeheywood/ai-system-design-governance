# 1.5.3 Enforcement Posture

This section defines the enforcement posture of the governance framework once unacceptable signals or unacceptable states are identified.

Enforcement posture describes **how decisively governance acts under uncertainty**, not the specific mechanisms used to act.

---

## 1.5.3.1 Purpose

The enforcement posture exists to:

* Remove ambiguity about when action is required
* Clarify where the burden of proof lies
* Prevent delay caused by risk normalisation or institutional hesitation

Without a defined posture, enforcement defaults to discretion — and discretion consistently favours continued operation.

## 1.5.3.2 Default Bias: Safety Over Continuity

Under this framework, governance adopts a **bias toward safety and legitimacy over continuity of operation**.

When credible uncertainty exists about whether a system has entered an unacceptable state:

* The default position is to **pause or constrain operation**
* Continuation must be actively justified

This bias is intentional and conservative.

---

## 1.5.3.3 Burden of Proof

The burden of proof rests with those advocating continued operation.

Specifically:

* It is not the responsibility of frontline staff or affected parties to prove harm
* It is the responsibility of system owners to demonstrate acceptability
* Absence of evidence of harm is not evidence of acceptability

This prevents governance paralysis under incomplete information.

## 1.5.3.4 Escalation Thresholds

Escalation is required when:

* Multiple unacceptable signals are present
* Any unacceptable state is plausibly reached
* Authority ambiguity prevents decisive action

Escalation does not require consensus, public incident, or legal breach.

---

## 1.5.3.5 Tolerance for False Positives

This framework explicitly tolerates **false positives** — situations where systems are paused or constrained and later determined to be acceptable.

It does not tolerate **false negatives** — situations where systems continue operating through unacceptable states.

This asymmetry reflects the irreversible nature of many AI-related harms.

---

## 1.5.3.6 Protection of Interveners

Individuals who raise concerns, trigger escalation, or exercise pause authority must be:

* Protected from retaliation
* Supported institutionally
* Treated as acting within governance mandate

Retaliation against interveners constitutes a secondary governance failure.

## 1.5.3.7 Public-Sector Context (Australia)

In Australian public-sector environments:

* Enforcement posture must align with public-interest obligations
* Operational pressure must not override lawful authority
* Political or reputational risk does not justify continued operation in unacceptable states

The legitimacy of enforcement derives from statutory duty, not outcome convenience.

---

## 1.5.3.8 Governance Implication

Once unacceptable states are defined, enforcement posture determines whether governance is real or performative.

This framework treats hesitation, deferral, or tolerance in the presence of unacceptable states as a failure of governance itself.
