# 1.5.4 Exclusion Criteria

This section defines the categories of AI-enabled systems and deployment contexts that are **excluded by design** from operation under this governance framework.

Exclusion criteria exist to prevent the framework from being used to legitimise systems that cannot be governed responsibly, regardless of intent, claimed benefit, or technical sophistication.

---

## 1.5.4.1 Purpose

Exclusion criteria serve to:

* Establish clear limits on what this framework will govern
* Prevent false confidence through inappropriate application
* Protect governance credibility by refusing unsafe legitimisation

Exclusion is not a judgement of technical merit. It is a governance boundary.

---

## 1.5.4.2 Principle of Governability

A system is eligible for governance under this framework only if it is **governable in practice**.

Governability requires:

* Clear authority to intervene
* Meaningful human oversight
* Actionable accountability pathways
* Feasible pause or shutdown capability

Systems that fail these conditions are excluded.

## 1.5.4.3 Excluded Category: Systems Without Effective Pause Capability

**Description**
Systems that cannot be safely paused, overridden, or terminated within an operationally relevant timeframe.

**Reason for exclusion**
Governance without stop capability is symbolic rather than real.

---

## 1.5.4.4 Excluded Category: Systems With Irreversible or Non-Remediable Impact

**Description**
Systems whose decisions create irreversible outcomes before governance intervention is possible.

**Reason for exclusion**
Post-hoc accountability cannot compensate for irreversible harm.

---

## 1.5.4.5 Excluded Category: Systems With Delegated or Diffuse Authority

**Description**
Systems where authority is intentionally fragmented to avoid responsibility.

**Reason for exclusion**
Diffuse authority prevents decisive intervention and enables blame shifting.

---

## 1.5.4.6 Excluded Category: Vendor-Controlled Governance Boundaries

**Description**
Systems where monitoring, thresholds, escalation, or constraints are primarily defined or controlled by vendors.

**Reason for exclusion**
Governance authority must reside with the deploying organisation or public body.

---

## 1.5.4.7 Excluded Category: Systems Designed to Avoid Accountability

**Description**
Systems intentionally structured to obscure decision logic, ownership, or responsibility.

**Reason for exclusion**
Opacity used as a defensive design choice undermines governance legitimacy.

---

## 1.5.4.8 Public-Sector Context (Australia)

In Australian public-sector deployments, exclusion applies where:

* Statutory accountability cannot be upheld
* Delegations are unclear or legally insufficient
* Public interest obligations cannot be enforced

No operational benefit overrides exclusion under these conditions.

---

## 1.5.4.9 Relationship to Unacceptable States

Exclusion criteria operate alongside unacceptable states:

* Unacceptable states trigger mandatory intervention
* Excluded systems must not enter operation at all

Exclusion is therefore preventative, not reactive.

---

## 1.5.4.10 Governance Implication

By defining exclusion criteria explicitly, this framework:

* Prevents misuse of governance language
* Establishes credible limits on legitimisation
* Protects downstream actors from ungovernable systems

Refusal to govern is, in some cases, the most responsible governance act.
