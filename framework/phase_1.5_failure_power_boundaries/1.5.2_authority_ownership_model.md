# 1.5.2 Authority & Ownership Model

This section defines how legitimate authority and ownership are established for AI-enabled systems once unacceptable states are recognised.

Its purpose is not to prescribe organisational structures, but to prevent ambiguity that would otherwise block intervention.

---

## 1.5.2.1 Purpose

The authority & ownership model exists to:

* Ensure a clearly identifiable decision authority exists at all times
* Align responsibility with the power to act
* Enable timely pause, override, or shutdown when unacceptable states are reached

Without this model, unacceptable states remain theoretical and unenforceable.

---

## 1.5.2.2 Authority vs Responsibility

Authority and responsibility must not be conflated.

* **Authority** is the legitimate right to approve, pause, override, or terminate system operation
* **Responsibility** is accountability for outcomes and impacts

A system is considered poorly governed when responsibility exists without authority, or authority exists without accountability.

---

## 1.5.2.3 Minimum Authority Requirements

For any AI-enabled system operating under this framework, the following must be true:

* A single accountable authority body or role can be named
* That authority has the power to pause or terminate operation
* That authority is reachable within an operationally relevant timeframe
* That authority is insulated from retaliation for exercising pause or override

If any of these conditions are unmet, the system is considered to be operating in an unacceptable state.

## 1.5.2.4 Ownership Boundaries

Ownership must be defined across the system lifecycle:

* **Design ownership** — who determines system capability and limits
* **Deployment ownership** — who approves use in a specific context
* **Operational ownership** — who oversees day-to-day behaviour
* **Impact ownership** — who is accountable for downstream consequences

Ownership may be distributed, but authority to intervene must remain explicit and consolidated.

## 1.5.2.5 Public-Sector Considerations (Australia)

In Australian public-sector contexts:

* Authority must align with statutory accountability
* Delegation must be explicit and documented
* Vendor assurances do not substitute for public accountability

Public servants must not be placed in positions where they are exposed to consequence without lawful authority to act.

---

## 1.5.2.6 Failure Mode: Shared Ownership Without Authority

A common failure pattern occurs when:

* Multiple parties are described as "co-owners"
* Decision rights are unclear or contested
* Escalation paths require consensus rather than action

In such cases, ownership language obscures the absence of real authority.

This framework treats shared ownership without decisive authority as an unacceptable governance condition.

---

## 1.5.2.7 Governance Implication

Authority must be defined *before* systems are allowed to operate.

If authority cannot be clearly named, intervention cannot be reliably exercised.

In such cases, non-operation is the only responsible governance position.
