# 2.1 Values Definition

This section defines the values that guide AI system design and governance **within the constitutional boundaries established in Phases 1 and 1.5**.

Values articulated here do not justify operation in unacceptable states, override exclusion criteria, or weaken enforcement posture. They function only where systems are already deemed governable.

---

## 2.1.1 Purpose of Values

Values in this framework serve to:

* Guide design choices where multiple acceptable options exist
* Shape trade-offs within permitted operational boundaries
* Inform prioritisation once governance legitimacy is established

Values are not a substitute for authority, enforcement, or accountability.

---

## 2.1.2 Boundary Conditions

All values defined in this phase are subject to the following non-negotiable constraints:

* They do not override unacceptable states
* They do not relax exclusion criteria
* They do not shift authority boundaries
* They do not delay mandatory intervention

If a value conflicts with these constraints, the value is invalid within this framework.

---

## 2.1.3 Core Governance Values

The following values apply to AI systems operating within acceptable governance bounds.

### Legitimacy

AI systems must operate under clearly established, socially and institutionally legitimate authority.

Legitimacy requires that:

* Authority is lawful and transparent
* Decision rights are publicly defensible
* Accountability pathways are explicit

### Responsibility

Responsibility must align with authority and capability.

This includes:

* Clear ownership of outcomes
* Ability to intervene when required
* Willingness to accept consequence for system behaviour

### Proportionality

The scope, autonomy, and impact of AI systems must be proportionate to:

* The risks they introduce
* The reversibility of their outcomes
* The strength of governance controls

Higher-impact systems demand stronger constraints.

### Contestability

Affected individuals must have meaningful avenues to:

* Question decisions
* Seek explanation
* Trigger review or appeal

Contestability must be practical, not merely theoretical.

### Precaution

Where uncertainty exists and harm may be irreversible, precaution takes precedence over optimisation.

This value reinforces the enforcement posture defined in Phase 1.5.

## 2.1.4 Values Explicitly Not Included

This framework intentionally does **not** elevate the following as primary governance values:

* Innovation speed
* Competitive advantage
* Cost reduction
* Model performance metrics

These considerations may influence implementation choices but do not function as governance values.

---

## 2.1.5 Relationship to Later Phases

These values inform:

* **Phase 3** design principles
* **Phase 4** testing criteria
* **Phase 5** operational review

They do not alter constitutional boundaries.

If later phases conflict with these values, design or operation must be adjusted. If values conflict with Phases 1 or 1.5, the values yield.

---

## 2.1.6 Governance Implication

By articulating values only after power boundaries are frozen, this framework:

* Prevents ethical laundering of risk
* Preserves enforcement legitimacy
* Enables principled design without governance drift

Values guide how systems operate — not whether they are allowed to operate.
