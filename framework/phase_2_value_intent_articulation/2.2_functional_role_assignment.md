# 2.2 Functional Role Assignment

This section defines how **human roles are assigned and preserved** within AI-enabled systems that operate inside the constitutional boundaries established in Phases 1 and 1.5.

Functional role assignment clarifies *what humans are expected to do*, independent of organisational titles, tooling, or system architecture.

Roles defined here constrain later system design. They are not derived from it.

---

## 2.2.1 Purpose

Functional role assignment exists to:

* Prevent silent delegation of human responsibility to systems
* Make human involvement explicit, durable, and non-optional
* Align authority, responsibility, and capability

Without explicit role definition, automation defaults to displacement rather than support.

---

## 2.2.2 Role vs Job Title

Roles in this framework are **functional**, not positional.

* A single person may hold multiple roles
* A role may be distributed across people
* A job title does not imply role coverage

Governance failure often occurs when roles are assumed rather than assigned.

---

## 2.2.3 Core Human Roles

The following roles must be explicitly assigned for any AI-enabled system operating under this framework.

### Decision Owner

**Function**
Holds legitimate authority for system-enabled decisions.

**Responsibilities**

* Approve use of the system in a defined context
* Accept accountability for outcomes
* Authorise pause, override, or shutdown

**Constraint**
Decision ownership must not be delegated to vendors or systems.

### Oversight Steward

**Function**
Maintains continuous awareness of system behaviour.

**Responsibilities**

* Monitor outputs and impacts
* Detect unacceptable signals
* Initiate escalation when required

**Constraint**
Oversight must be active, not symbolic.

---

### Intervention Authority

**Function**
Exercises immediate control when unacceptable states are reached.

**Responsibilities**

* Execute pause or override
* Contain impact during incidents
* Coordinate response actions

**Constraint**
Intervention authority must be reachable and empowered in practice.

---

### Accountability Holder

**Function**
Ensures consequences are owned and addressed.

**Responsibilities**

* Lead post-incident review
* Ensure remediation occurs
* Accept institutional accountability

**Constraint**
Accountability must not be diffused across committees.

---

## 2.2.4 Role Assignment Requirements

For each AI-enabled system:

* All core roles must be explicitly named
* Role assignments must be documented
* Authority boundaries must be unambiguous
* Role holders must have sufficient capacity and protection

If any required role is unassigned or symbolic, the system is not considered governable.

---

## 2.2.5 Public-Sector Context (Australia)

In Australian public-sector deployments:

* Functional roles must align with statutory duties
* Delegations must be lawful and explicit
* Contractors may support roles but cannot replace accountable officials

Public accountability cannot be outsourced.

---

## 2.2.6 Common Failure Patterns

This framework explicitly rejects the following patterns:

* “The system decided” replacing human decision ownership
* Committees substituting for named authority
* Vendors positioned as de facto overseers
* Frontline workers absorbing accountability without power

These patterns indicate governance failure.

---

## 2.2.7 Relationship to Later Phases

Functional role assignment constrains:

* **Phase 3** system architecture (roles must be supported)
* **Phase 4** testing (roles must be exercised)
* **Phase 5** operations (roles must remain active)

Systems that erode or bypass assigned roles violate this framework.

---

## 2.2.8 Governance Implication

Explicit functional role assignment ensures that AI systems remain **human-governed**, not merely human-adjacent.

Where roles cannot be assigned credibly, system operation is not legitimate under this framework.
