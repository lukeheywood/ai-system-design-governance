# 4.2 Failure Mode Testing

This section defines **failure mode testing** as the deliberate induction and examination of system breakdown conditions to verify that governance constraints hold when systems fail.

Failure mode testing assumes that failure is inevitable. Its purpose is to ensure that failure remains **containable, observable, and governable**.

---

## 4.2.1 Purpose

Failure mode testing exists to:

* Confirm that systems fail safely rather than catastrophically
* Validate that unacceptable states trigger mandatory intervention
* Test remediation, rollback, and shutdown paths
* Ensure accountability does not disappear during failure

A system that cannot fail safely is not governable.

---

## 4.2.2 Failure Modes vs Edge Cases

Failure modes are not rare anomalies.

They include:

* Predictable degradation under load
* Human error or absence
* Dependency failure (vendors, infrastructure, data)
* Drift into unacceptable states

Testing only edge cases produces false confidence.

---

## 4.2.3 Required Failure Mode Categories

At minimum, failure mode testing must include the following categories.

### Authority Failure

Tests where:

* Decision owners are unavailable
* Conflicting authority claims arise
* Escalation paths are ambiguous

**Expected outcome:** the system pauses or constrains itself until authority is restored.

---

### Control Path Failure

Tests where:

* Pause or override interfaces are degraded
* Control actions are delayed or blocked
* Interface usability breaks under stress

**Expected outcome:** fail-safe behaviour activates without reliance on normal controls.

---

### Oversight Blindness

Tests where:

* Monitoring data is incomplete or delayed
* Alerts are suppressed or noisy
* Operators lack situational awareness

**Expected outcome:** conservative system behaviour and escalation.

---

### Model or Logic Failure

Tests where:

* Models produce incoherent or extreme outputs
* Decision logic behaves unpredictably
* Confidence signals are misleading

**Expected outcome:** outputs are constrained or rejected pending review.

---

### Dependency Collapse

Tests where:

* Vendor services are unavailable
* External APIs fail
* Data pipelines are disrupted

**Expected outcome:** internal governance authority remains decisive; systems do not defer control externally.

---

## 4.2.4 Inducing Failure

Failure modes must be:

* Actively induced, not merely observed
* Tested under realistic timing and pressure
* Executed without special safeguards that would not exist in real operation

Simulated failure that avoids discomfort is insufficient.

---

## 4.2.5 Pass / Fail Criteria

A failure mode test is considered failed if:

* The system continues operating through an unacceptable state
* Authority cannot be exercised when required
* Control paths do not function as designed
* Accountability is unclear or deferred

Failure requires remediation before deployment or continued use.

---

## 4.2.6 Documentation and Evidence

Each failure mode test must produce:

* A clear description of the induced failure
* Timeline of system and human responses
* Identification of governance breakdowns
* Evidence of corrective actions taken

Undocumented failure testing is treated as untested.

---

## 4.2.7 Public-Sector Context (Australia)

In Australian public-sector deployments:

* Failure testing must include statutory and accountability stress
* Outcomes must be reviewable by oversight bodies
* Known failure modes must not be deferred to operational risk acceptance

Public systems must be safe to fail.

---

## 4.2.8 Relationship to Scenario Stress Testing

Failure mode testing complements scenario stress testing:

* Scenario testing explores plausible futures
* Failure testing forces known breakdowns

Both are required for governance credibility.

---

## 4.2.9 Governance Implication

Governance that avoids testing failure modes is governance that relies on hope.

Failure mode testing ensures that when systems fail — as they will — authority, control, and accountability do not fail wit
