# 4.3 Remediation and Retest

This section defines the requirements for **remediation and retesting** following failed scenario stress tests or failure mode tests.

Remediation is not optional. Systems that fail governance tests must demonstrate corrected behaviour **before** deployment or continued operation.

---

## 4.3.1 Purpose

Remediation and retest exist to:

* Ensure failures lead to structural correction, not explanation
* Prevent recurrence of known governance breakdowns
* Restore confidence that freezes and constraints still hold

A system that fails and is not remediated is considered ungovernable.

---

## 4.3.2 Trigger Conditions

Remediation is mandatory when:

* A scenario stress test fails (4.1)
* A failure mode test fails (4.2)
* An unacceptable state is entered during testing
* Authority, control, or oversight cannot be exercised as required

No deployment or continued operation is permitted until remediation is complete.

---

## 4.3.3 Remediation Requirements

Remediation must:

* Address the root governance cause, not symptoms
* Modify architecture, interfaces, or role assignments as needed
* Eliminate bypass paths that enabled failure
* Be reviewed by the appropriate authority owner

Superficial fixes or compensating process controls are insufficient.

---

## 4.3.4 Documentation of Remediation

Each remediation effort must produce:

* A clear description of the failure
* Identification of violated principles or constraints
* Specific corrective actions taken
* Residual risks that remain

This documentation becomes part of the system’s governance record.

---

## 4.3.5 Retest Requirements

After remediation:

* All failed tests must be rerun
* Related scenarios must be re-executed
* No assumptions of fix effectiveness are permitted

Retesting must demonstrate that:

* The original failure no longer occurs
* No new unacceptable states are introduced

---

## 4.3.6 Failure of Retest

If a system fails retest:

* Further remediation is required
* Deployment remains prohibited
* Escalation to governance authority is mandatory

Repeated failure may indicate systemic ungovernability.

---

## 4.3.7 Public-Sector Context (Australia)

In Australian public-sector deployments:

* Remediation outcomes must be auditable
* Known failures must not be waived for operational expediency
* Retest evidence must support lawful decision-making

Public trust requires visible correction, not quiet tolerance of failure.

---

## 4.3.8 Relationship to Phase Freezes

Remediation and retest:

* Must respect freezes from Phases 1–3
* Must not weaken architectural or constitutional constraints
* May require design changes but not boundary redefinition

If remediation requires altering frozen phases, a formal amendment is required.

---

## 4.3.9 Governance Implication

Testing without remediation is theatre.

Remediation and retest ensure that governance failures lead to **durable correction**, not institutional forgetting.
