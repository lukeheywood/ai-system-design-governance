# 3.3 Control and Oversight Interfaces

This section defines the **control and oversight interfaces** through which humans exercise authority, oversight, and intervention over AI-enabled systems.

These interfaces are governance-critical surfaces. If they fail, governance fails — regardless of policy, intent, or system capability.

---

## 3.3.1 Purpose

Control and oversight interfaces exist to:

* Make human authority operational, not symbolic
* Provide real-time visibility into system state and behaviour
* Enable timely pause, override, and shutdown
* Support escalation before unacceptable states materialise

Interfaces are treated as part of the governance architecture, not optional tooling.

---

## 3.3.2 Principle: Authority Must Be Actionable

Interfaces must allow authorised humans to:

* Intervene without technical mediation
* Act within operationally relevant timeframes
* Exercise control without fear of penalty or obstruction

An authority that cannot be exercised through an interface does not exist in practice.

---

## 3.3.3 Required Interface Capabilities

All governed systems must provide interfaces that support the following capabilities.

### System State Visibility

Interfaces must display:

* Current operational status
* Active models or decision components
* Known limitations or degraded modes
* Detected unacceptable signals

State visibility must be understandable to role holders defined in Phase 2.

---

### Decision Traceability

Interfaces must allow authorised users to:

* Inspect recent system decisions
* Identify contributing components
* Understand decision context and scope

Traceability is required for oversight, review, and accountability.

---

### Pause and Override Controls

Interfaces must provide:

* Clearly labelled pause and override actions
* Immediate effect when exercised
* Confirmation of successful execution

Controls must not be buried, rate-limited, or restricted to exceptional circumstances.

---

### Escalation and Notification

Interfaces must support:

* Automatic alerts when unacceptable signals are detected
* Manual escalation by human operators
* Clear routing to intervention authority

Escalation pathways must be explicit and auditable.

---

## 3.3.4 Role-Specific Interfaces

Interfaces should be aligned to functional roles, not generic users.

At minimum:

* **Oversight Stewards** require monitoring and alerting views
* **Intervention Authorities** require direct control interfaces
* **Decision Owners** require summary, status, and accountability views

Misaligned interfaces are a common source of governance failure.

---

## 3.3.5 Prohibited Interface Patterns

The following patterns are explicitly prohibited:

* Control actions hidden behind multiple layers or approvals
* Interfaces accessible only to vendors or technical specialists
* Read-only dashboards presented as governance control
* Retrospective reporting substituted for live oversight

Such patterns create the illusion of governance without control.

---

## 3.3.6 Resilience Under Stress

Control and oversight interfaces must remain functional:

* During system degradation
* Under high load or incident conditions
* When other system components fail

Interfaces that degrade alongside the system undermine governance at precisely the moment it is needed.

---

## 3.3.7 Public-Sector Context (Australia)

In Australian public-sector deployments:

* Interfaces must support statutory decision-makers
* Control actions must be attributable and logged
* Oversight interfaces must be auditable

Public accountability requirements apply to interface design, not just backend logic.

---

## 3.3.8 Relationship to Other Phases

Control and oversight interfaces:

* Implement authority models defined in Phase 1.5
* Enable functional roles defined in Phase 2
* Constrain system behaviour defined in Phase 3

If interfaces do not support these functions, the system is not governable under this framework.

---

## 3.3.9 Governance Implication

Governance does not fail because people lack intent.

It fails when control is abstracted away behind systems, processes, or interfaces that cannot be used when it matters.

Effective governance requires interfaces that make authority visible, usable, and durable.
