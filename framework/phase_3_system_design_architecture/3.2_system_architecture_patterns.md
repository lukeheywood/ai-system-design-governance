# 3.2 System Architecture Patterns

This section defines **permitted and disallowed system architecture patterns** for AI-enabled systems governed under this framework.

Where architectural principles (3.1) define *what must be true*, architecture patterns define *how systems may or may not be structured* in practice.

Patterns are evaluated on governability, not technical elegance.

---

## 3.2.1 Purpose

System architecture patterns exist to:

* Translate abstract principles into concrete structural choices
* Prevent known governance failure modes from reappearing through design
* Provide clear guidance on acceptable and unacceptable system shapes

Patterns defined here are binding. Deviations require explicit governance review.

## 3.2.2 Pattern: Layered Decision Architecture (Permitted)

**Description**
Decision-making is separated into distinct layers with clear boundaries:

* Data ingestion layer
* Model inference layer
* Decision interpretation layer
* Human decision layer

**Why this is permitted**
Layering preserves legibility, supports intervention, and prevents direct coupling between model output and real-world action.

**Governance properties**

* Clear intervention points
* Traceable decision flow
* Human authority preserved

## 3.2.3 Pattern: Human-in-the-Loop with Explicit Control (Permitted)

**Description**
Systems generate recommendations or options, but humans explicitly authorise consequential actions.

**Why this is permitted**
This pattern aligns with functional role assignment and human control guarantees.

**Governance properties**

* Human authority is explicit
* Override and pause are practical
* Accountability remains human

---

## 3.2.4 Pattern: Control Plane / Execution Plane Separation (Permitted)

**Description**
Governance, monitoring, and control functions are architecturally separated from operational execution.

**Why this is permitted**
This separation ensures that governance controls cannot be bypassed by operational logic or system optimisation.

**Governance properties**

* Independent intervention pathways
* Protection against self-modification
* Reliable shutdown capability

---

## 3.2.5 Pattern: Fully Autonomous Closed-Loop Systems (Disallowed)

**Description**
Systems that sense, decide, and act without enforced human checkpoints.

**Reason for disallowance**
Such systems violate human control guarantees and fail-safe requirements.

---

## 3.2.6 Pattern: Self-Modifying Governance Logic (Disallowed)

**Description**
Systems that alter their own constraints, thresholds, or escalation logic.

**Reason for disallowance**
Governance boundaries must remain human-defined and stable.

---

## 3.2.7 Pattern: Vendor-Managed Control Planes (Disallowed)

**Description**
Critical governance functions (monitoring, pause, escalation) are controlled or hosted exclusively by vendors.

**Reason for disallowance**
This displaces authority outside accountable structures.

---

## 3.2.8 Pattern: Event-Driven Escalation Architecture (Permitted)

**Description**
Systems emit governance-relevant events that trigger review, pause, or escalation workflows.

**Why this is permitted**
Event-driven designs support early detection of unacceptable signals and rapid intervention.

**Governance properties**

* Observable state changes
* Timely escalation
* Auditable triggers

---

## 3.2.9 Pattern: Sandboxed Learning Environments (Permitted)

**Description**
Learning and experimentation occur in isolated environments before promotion to production.

**Why this is permitted**
This prevents unreviewed learning from directly affecting live decisions.

**Governance properties**

* Controlled promotion pathways
* Reviewable model changes
* Reduced blast radius

---

## 3.2.10 Relationship to Architecture Principles

All patterns must satisfy the principles defined in **3.1 Architecture Principles**.

If a pattern conflicts with those principles, it is invalid regardless of technical benefit.

---

## 3.2.11 Governance Implication

Explicit architecture patterns:

* Reduce ambiguity in system design
* Make governance expectations enforceable
* Prevent known failure modes from re-entering through abstraction

Architectures outside these patterns require explicit justification and approval.
