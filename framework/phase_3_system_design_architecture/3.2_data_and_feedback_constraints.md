# 3.2 Data and Feedback Constraints

## Purpose

This section defines **governance constraints on data flows and feedback mechanisms** within governed systems.

Data and feedback are not neutral technical features. They are **mechanisms through which authority, influence, and behavioural change propagate over time**.

Without explicit constraints, feedback pathways enable systems to evolve, optimise, or drift **without a corresponding governance decision**, resulting in unowned power transfer.

This section exists to prevent **silent system evolution**.

## Governing Principle

> **No system may materially change its behaviour over time without an accountable authority being able to observe, authorise, and interrupt that change.**

Adaptation without authority is not learning. It is loss of control.

## Data as a Governance Surface

Within governed systems, data is not merely an input.

Data:

* encodes assumptions,
* shapes future system behaviour,
* reinforces incentives,
* and determines what the system is capable of noticing or ignoring.

For this reason, **data pipelines constitute a governance surface**, not just a technical one.

Any system operating under this framework must ensure that:

* the provenance of data is inspectable,
* the purpose of data use is explicit,
* and the consequences of data reuse or feedback are foreseeable in principle.

If data use cannot be explained at a governance level, it is not governance-compatible.

## Feedback Loop Constraints

Systems frequently incorporate feedback loops, including but not limited to:

* performance optimisation,
* prioritisation or ranking adjustment,
* behavioural reinforcement,
* rule or parameter updates,
* operator behaviour shaped by system outputs.

These feedback loops **must not be implicit or emergent**.

### Required Properties

All feedback loops must be:

1. **Identifiable**
   It must be possible to point to where feedback enters the system.

2. **Bounded**
   The scope and impact of feedback must be constrained by design.

3. **Interruptible**
   A human or institutional authority must be able to pause or disable feedback without causing system collapse.

4. **Owned**
   A named authority must be responsible for approving the feedback loop and accountable for its downstream effects.

Feedback loops that do not meet these criteria are considered **governance failures**, regardless of technical performance.

## Prevention of Silent Adaptation

A system is in an **unacceptable governance state** if it:

* materially changes behaviour over time,
* affects outcomes or decisions,
* and does so without an explicit, reviewable trigger or authorisation point.

To prevent silent adaptation:

* adaptation triggers must be explicit,
* thresholds for change must be knowable,
* review checkpoints must exist *before* significant behavioural shifts occur.

Silent adaptation is treated as a **loss of authority**, not as acceptable optimisation.

---

## Monitoring vs. Feedback

Monitoring and feedback are distinct governance concepts.

* **Monitoring** observes system behaviour.
* **Feedback** alters future system behaviour.

Systems must be designed such that:

* monitoring does not automatically become feedback,
* observation does not implicitly authorise change.

Any transition from monitoring to feedback constitutes a **governance decision** and must be treated as such.

---

## Authority Alignment

For each data pathway and feedback loop, the following questions must be answerable:

* Who authorised its existence?
* Who can suspend or terminate it?
* Who bears responsibility for its downstream effects?

If these questions cannot be answered clearly, the system has exceeded its governance envelope.

---

## Architectural Implications

Governance-aligned systems should prefer architectures where:

* feedback pathways are explicit rather than emergent,
* adaptation is optional rather than mandatory,
* system behaviour can be stabilised without loss of core function.

Systems that require continuous, unbounded feedback to operate demand **exceptional justification** and heightened scrutiny.

## Boundary Statement

This framework does not prescribe *how* data pipelines or feedback mechanisms are implemented.

It defines **what must be true** for them to be legitimate.

Implementation choices remain flexible.
**Authority, inspectability, and interruptibility do not.**
