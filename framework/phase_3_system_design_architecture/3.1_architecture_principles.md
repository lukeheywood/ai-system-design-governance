# 3.1 Architecture Principles

This section defines the architectural principles that govern the design of AI-enabled systems operating under this framework.

These principles translate the constitutional constraints (Phases 1 and 1.5) and value commitments (Phase 2) into **non-negotiable system design guidance**.

Architecture is treated here as a governance surface, not a purely technical concern.

---

## 3.1.1 Purpose

Architecture principles exist to:

* Encode governance constraints directly into system structure
* Prevent reliance on policy or human vigilance alone
* Ensure systems remain governable under scale, complexity, and stress

Design choices that violate these principles are considered governance failures, not implementation trade-offs.

---

## 3.1.2 Principle: Governability by Design

Systems must be architected so that:

* Authority can be exercised in practice, not just in theory
* Intervention pathways are explicit and reliable
* Oversight does not depend on exceptional effort

If a system cannot be governed through its architecture, it must not rely on process to compensate.

---

## 3.1.3 Principle: Explicit Control Planes

Control functions must be architecturally distinct from execution functions.

This includes:

* Separate control planes for pause, override, and shutdown
* Clear interfaces for human intervention
* Protection of control planes from system self-modification

Control that is embedded only within operational logic is insufficient.

---

## 3.1.4 Principle: Human Authority Anchoring

Architectures must clearly anchor:

* Decision authority
* Oversight visibility
* Intervention capability

These anchors must map directly to the human roles defined in Phase 2.

Systems that obscure or dilute authority through abstraction violate this principle.

## 3.1.5 Principle: Fail-Safe Over Fail-Open

When uncertainty, degradation, or anomaly occurs:

* Systems must default to safe, constrained, or paused states
* Recovery must require explicit human authorisation

Fail-open behaviour is prohibited in high-impact contexts.

---

## 3.1.6 Principle: Reversibility and Containment

Architectures must:

* Support rollback of decisions and changes where feasible
* Contain impact when failures occur
* Avoid cascading effects across systems

Irreversible impact must be minimised by design, not justified post hoc.

---

## 3.1.7 Principle: Legibility Over Optimisation

Systems must prioritise:

* Clear state visibility
* Explainable decision pathways for operators
* Traceability of actions and changes

Architectures that maximise performance at the expense of legibility undermine governance.

---

## 3.1.8 Principle: Separation of Learning and Action

Where learning components exist:

* Learning must be isolated from direct action
* Model updates must not bypass governance review
* Feedback loops must be observable and interruptible

Self-modifying systems without enforced separation are excluded by design.

---

## 3.1.9 Public-Sector Context (Australia)

In Australian public-sector systems:

* Architecture must support statutory accountability
* Decision pathways must be auditable
* Vendor-managed components must not control governance-critical functions

Public accountability requirements override architectural convenience.

---

## 3.1.10 Relationship to Later Sections

These principles constrain:

* **3.2 System Architecture Patterns**
* **3.3 Control & Oversight Interfaces**
* **3.4 Data & Model Governance**

If a proposed architecture conflicts with these principles, it is invalid under this framework.

---

## 3.1.11 Governance Implication

Architecture is where governance either becomes durable or collapses.

These principles ensure that governance survives:

* scale
* automation
* organisational change
* and pressure to optimise

Systems designed outside these principles are not eligible for operation under this framework.
