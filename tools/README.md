# Tools

This directory contains **practical diagnostic and orientation tools** derived from the
_System-Level AI System Design & Governance Framework_.

These tools are **not the framework itself**.
They are lightweight instruments designed to help humans reason clearly
about governance reality in real-world contexts.

---

## What these tools are

The tools in this directory are:

- **Diagnostic aids**, not mandates
- **Conversation supports**, not interrogations
- **Orientation instruments**, not audits
- **Decision filters**, not verdict engines

They exist to help identify whether governance can meaningfully attach to a system
_before_ deeper analysis, responsibility, or risk is accepted.

---

## What these tools are not

These tools do **not**:

- certify compliance
- assert facts about organisations
- determine intent or fault
- replace formal governance processes
- function as checklists for enforcement

They should never be treated as authoritative requirements.

---

## Relationship to the framework

The core governance framework defines:

- what can be governed
- who may govern
- where boundaries and enforcement apply
- how governance propagates through systems

The tools in this directory **apply those principles in practice**
without redefining them.

Think of the relationship this way:

> **The framework defines the rules of the game.  
> These tools help you see whether the game is playable.**

---

## Using these tools responsibly

These tools are designed to be used:

- gradually
- observationally
- alongside normal professional interaction
- with respect for incomplete information

They are not intended to be deployed as forms, demands, or tests.

Silence, ambiguity, and discomfort are signals — not failures.

---

## One-Pagers

The `/one-pagers/` directory contains single-page tools for specific moments:

- **Governance Diagnostic**  
  A fast screen to assess whether a system is governable in principle.

- **System Entry**  
  An orientation aid for the first phase of engagement once a system is entered.

Additional tools may be added over time, but all follow the same principles:
minimal surface area, maximal clarity.

---

## Ethical boundary

These tools are deliberately constrained to avoid:

- naming organisations
- extracting sensitive detail
- creating attack surfaces
- encouraging disclosure beyond what is appropriate

Concrete system risks and failures must be addressed privately.

---

## Interpretive posture

Outputs generated using these tools are **interpretive**, not factual.
They reflect structured reasoning under uncertainty and may evolve
as context changes.

Disagreement is expected.
The purpose of these tools is not agreement — it is clarity.

---

## Final note

If a tool increases pressure, fear, or defensiveness,
it is being used incorrectly.

Governance that only works when everyone is calm is not governance.
But governance discovery should still feel humane.
