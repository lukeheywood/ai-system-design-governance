System Entry — One-Pager

(Phase-1 orientation tool for newly entered systems)

Purpose

A structured way to establish shared understanding of a system’s governance reality
before making recommendations, changes, or commitments.

This tool does not judge the system.
It establishes where the lines already are — and where they are missing.

How to use this (important)

This is completed over time, not in one meeting

Answers are gathered from documents, conversations, and behaviour

“Unclear” is a valid and important state

You are mapping reality, not demanding perfection

Section A — System Framing (Phase 1.1)

Prompt:

What is this system for, in plain terms?

Capture:

Stated purpose / intent

Primary outcomes it influences

Who experiences impact if it fails or misbehaves

☐ Purpose is clear and shared
☐ Purpose exists but varies by role
☐ Purpose is implicit or contested

Section B — Scope & Influence (Phase 1.2)

Prompt:

Where does this system have real influence?

Capture:

Decisions it informs, recommends, or executes

Downstream systems or actors affected

Where influence extends beyond formal ownership

☐ Influence is bounded and understood
☐ Influence exists but is wider than acknowledged
☐ Influence is diffuse or unknown

Section C — Ownership & Authority (Phase 1.3)

Prompt:

Who owns outcomes when this system is under stress?

Capture:

Named owner(s) of outcomes (not tasks)

Decision authority under normal conditions

Decision authority under pressure or failure

☐ Ownership and authority are explicit
☐ Ownership exists but authority is weak
☐ Responsibility without authority is present

Section D — Failure & Unacceptable States (Phase 1.5 preview)

Prompt:

What outcomes would we all agree are unacceptable?

Capture:

Clearly named unacceptable outcomes

Whether they are documented or implicit

Whether anyone is accountable for preventing them

☐ Unacceptable outcomes are explicit
☐ Outcomes are recognised but undocumented
☐ No shared definition of unacceptable outcomes

Section E — Boundary Signals

Prompt:

How does the system signal it is no longer operating within intent?

Capture:

Known warning signs or thresholds (formal or informal)

Who notices first when integrity degrades

Whether signals lead to action or normalization

☐ Boundary signals are defined and acted on
☐ Signals exist but are ignored or delayed
☐ No reliable boundary signals

Section F — Entry Assessment (for you)

Based on what you now see:

☐ Governance is structurally sound

☐ Governance is fragile but improvable

☐ Governance gaps expose role-holder to risk

Notes (private):
Where are you being asked to compensate for missing structure?

What this produces

A shared map, not a verdict

Early identification of governance gaps

Inputs for:

Phase 1 formal documentation

Phase 2 value & intent articulation

Pattern backlog entries (if applicable)

Important reminder

Completing this one-pager does not obligate you to:

fix the system

accept the role

absorb unowned risk

It exists so you can decide what you are actually being asked to hold.
