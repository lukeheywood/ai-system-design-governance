Governance Diagnostic — One-Pager

(Fast system-level screening tool)

Purpose

A rapid diagnostic to determine whether a system is governable in principle
before deeper analysis, design, or engagement.

This tool does not assess quality, performance, or compliance.
It only answers one question:

Is there something here that governance can meaningfully attach to?

How to use this (important)

You do not ask all of these questions directly.

You listen for answers across conversation, documents, behaviour, and silences.

Partial answers are expected.

Evasion is a signal.

Section A — Object Clarity (0.1)

Question:

Can the thing being governed be clearly named and bounded?

Look for evidence that:

The system’s purpose or intent can be stated in plain language

There is a shared understanding of what outcomes it influences

There is agreement on what is in scope vs out of scope

Signals

🟢 Clear, consistent descriptions

🟡 Multiple vague descriptions, some alignment

🔴 “It depends”, “it’s evolving”, or no shared framing

Section B — Legitimate Authority (0.2)

Question:

Is there a recognised authority that can say “no”, “stop”, or “change direction”?

Look for evidence that:

Someone (person or body) is authorised to constrain the system

That authority is accepted under pressure, not just on paper

Responsibility is not merely advisory or symbolic

Signals

🟢 Authority is explicit and enforceable

🟡 Authority exists but weak, shared, or conditional

🔴 “Everyone owns it”, “the team decides”, or no answer

Section C — Boundary & Enforcement (0.3)

Question:

What happens when the system violates its own intent or causes harm?

Look for evidence that:

There are defined boundaries on acceptable operation

There is a fallback, pause, or override mechanism

Enforcement does not rely solely on goodwill or escalation theatre

Signals

🟢 Boundaries and consequences are explicit

🟡 Boundaries exist but enforcement is unclear

🔴 “We’ve never needed that”, “we’ll handle it if it happens”

Section D — Integrity Under Pressure

Question:

Does governance strengthen or weaken as stakes increase?

Look for evidence that:

Governance mechanisms still apply under deadlines, scale, or crisis

Commercial, political, or reputational pressure does not override authority

Trade-offs are acknowledged, not denied

Signals

🟢 Pressure scenarios are openly discussed

🟡 Pressure acknowledged but unmanaged

🔴 Pressure framed as justification to bypass controls

Outcome
🟢 Green — Governable

Governance can attach.
Deeper Phase 1 analysis is worth doing.

🟡 Amber — Fragile

Governance exists but will likely fail under pressure.
Proceed only with explicit mandate to strengthen it.

🔴 Red — Ungovernable

No stable object, authority, or enforcement.
Any role here will absorb risk without control.

Important note

This diagnostic:

makes no claims

assigns no blame

determines no intent

It only answers whether governance has something solid to stand on.

If not, the correct response is not optimisation — it is refusal or redesign.
