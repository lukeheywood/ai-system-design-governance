# One-Pagers

This directory contains **single-page diagnostic and orientation tools** derived from the
_System-Level AI System Design & Governance Framework_.

Each one-pager is designed for use in a **specific moment**:
before engagement, at entry, or during early system understanding.

They prioritise clarity, restraint, and real-world usability.

---

## What these one-pagers are

One-pagers are:

- **Fast lenses**, not deep analyses
- **Conversation companions**, not questionnaires
- **Orientation aids**, not governance artifacts
- **Decision supports**, not decisions

They are intentionally minimal.
Their value comes from *what they surface*, not what they demand.

---

## What these one-pagers are not

These tools are **not**:

- audits
- assessments
- checklists for compliance
- evidence of failure
- substitutes for formal governance processes

They should not be presented as requirements, forms, or tests.

If a one-pager is treated as authoritative, it is being misused.

---

## How to use them (important)

- Do **not** ask every question directly.
- Use them to **listen**, not interrogate.
- Answers may emerge over multiple conversations.
- Silence, ambiguity, and discomfort are signals.

The goal is to understand **governability**, not correctness.

## Available one-pagers

### Governance Diagnostic
A fast screening tool used **before deeper engagement**.

It helps answer:
> *Is there something here that governance can meaningfully attach to?*

Typical use cases:
- role consideration
- early conversations
- system triage
- interview filtering

---

### System Entry
An orientation tool used **after a green light**, once you are inside a system.

It helps establish:
- shared understanding of purpose and scope
- where authority and ownership actually sit
- where implicit risk already exists

Typical use cases:
- first 30–60 days in a role
- initial system review
- early design or governance work

---

## Relationship to the framework

The one-pagers **do not define governance**.

They rely on:
- the constitutional grounding phases (0.1–0.3)
- Phase 1 problem recognition concepts

They are intentionally incomplete without the framework.

Think of them as:
> **Field instruments built on top of a constitution.**

---

## Ethical and disclosure boundary

One-pagers are designed to avoid:
- naming organisations
- eliciting sensitive detail
- creating attribution or blame
- generating publishable claims

They support **private reasoning**, not public exposure.

Any public artefacts derived from this work must be abstracted
through governance patterns or framework documentation.

---

## Interpretive posture

Outputs from these one-pagers are **interpretive**.

They reflect structured reasoning under uncertainty
and may change as context, evidence, or authority shifts.

They are starting points — not conclusions.

---

## Final note

If a one-pager feels heavy, adversarial, or procedural,
it is being used incorrectly.

These tools exist to help you decide **where to stand** —
not to force others to justify themselves.
