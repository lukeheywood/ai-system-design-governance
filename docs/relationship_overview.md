# Relationship Overview — System-Level Governance

> **Status:** Supporting reference (non-constitutional)
>
> **Role:** Conceptual orientation and analogy

This document provides a high-level view of how the **System Governance Framework** relates to systems, organisations, and people.

It uses analogy and relationship mapping to clarify roles without introducing new obligations.

---

## Framework as Constitution

The framework functions like a constitution:

* it defines what must be true,
* it constrains what is legitimate,
* it does not prescribe day-to-day operations.

Systems may be built in many ways.
Only some are **governance-legitimate**.

## System as Operative Entity

A system is the operative entity:

* it makes or influences decisions,
* it processes inputs into outcomes,
* it operates under real-world constraints.

Systems are accountable to the framework.
The framework is not accountable to systems.

## People and Authority

People relate to systems in different ways:

* designers and builders shape architecture,
* operators interact with interfaces,
* reviewers and governors assess legitimacy.

Authority must be:

* explicit,
* bounded,
* and enforceable.

Where authority is absent or implicit, governance fails regardless of intent.

## Why This Is Not Ethics

This framework does not ask:

* what is good or bad,
* what values should be held,
* or what outcomes are desirable.

It asks:

* who is authorised,
* who can intervene,
* who bears responsibility,
* and whether control exists.

Ethical discussion may follow.
Governance must precede it.

## Stress Cases and Visibility

Certain system classes make governance gaps easier to see.

AI-enabled systems are one such stress case because they often:

* adapt over time,
* obscure internal reasoning,
* operate continuously.

They are examples, not exceptions.

## Boundary Statement

This overview is explanatory.

It does not modify, extend, or reinterpret the constitutional framework.
Its purpose is clarity, not persuasion.
