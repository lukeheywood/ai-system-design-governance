# Documentation — Interpretive References

> **Status:** Supporting documentation (non-constitutional)
>
> **Scope:** System Governance Framework
>
> **Audience:** System-adjacent professionals

This folder contains **interpretive reference material** that supports understanding and safe use of the **System Governance Framework**.

These documents are **not part of the constitutional framework**. They do not define requirements, scope eligibility, or enforcement conditions.

Their purpose is to improve clarity, orientation, and legibility — particularly for practitioners who operate downstream of authority and upstream of outcomes.

## What These Documents Are

The documents in this folder:

* provide conceptual orientation and shared language,
* explain how the framework relates to real systems,
* help readers recognise structural absence or incompleteness,
* support discussion without accusation or prescription.

They exist to reduce ambiguity, not to mandate action.

---

## What These Documents Are Not

These documents are not:

* part of the framework’s constitutional spine,
* a checklist, policy, or compliance guide,
* an implementation manual,
* a definition of what qualifies as AI,
* a substitute for organisational authority.

Nothing in this folder overrides or modifies the requirements defined in the framework phases.

---

## Relationship to the Framework

The **System Governance Framework** defines *what must be true* for a system to be legitimate.

The documents in this folder:

* explain *how to read and reason with the framework*,
* help map the framework onto existing systems,
* support interpretation across enterprise and public-sector contexts.

If there is any conflict between these documents and the framework phases, **the framework phases take precedence**.

## Boundary Statement

These documents are intentionally:

* read-only in posture,
* non-prescriptive in tone,
* and limited to explanation rather than instruction.

They exist to support clarity.

The framework’s authority comes from its structure, not from these references.
