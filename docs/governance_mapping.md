# Governance Mapping — From Framework to System

> **Status:** Supporting reference (non-constitutional)
>
> **Role:** Mapping and diagnostic aid

This document explains how the **System Governance Framework** relates to real systems.

It clarifies the distinction between:

* the framework (what must be true), and
* individual systems (where and whether it is true).

## Framework vs. System

The framework is **not a system**.

It does not run, decide, or operate.
It defines **conditions of legitimacy**.

A system may:

* align with the framework,
* partially align,
* or violate it.

Mapping is the act of making that alignment (or misalignment) explicit.

## What Mapping Is

Governance mapping is the process of identifying:

* where authority exists,
* where control boundaries are enforced or missing,
* where responsibility is assigned or assumed,
* where adaptation or drift is governed or ungoverned.

Mapping does **not** repair systems.
It reveals structure.

## Why Mapping Matters

In many organisations:

* responsibility is felt but not authorised,
* escalation exists without enforcement,
* governance exists on paper but not in architecture.

Mapping makes these conditions visible.

It allows practitioners to say:

> “This system is structurally incomplete.”

without accusing individuals or proposing solutions prematurely.

## Typical Mapping Surfaces

When mapping a system against the framework, attention is usually paid to:

* decision points and authority boundaries,
* control and oversight interfaces,
* data and feedback pathways,
* deployment and revocation conditions.

The goal is not exhaustive documentation, but **legibility of power and control**.

---

## What Mapping Is Not

Mapping is not:

* an audit,
* a compliance exercise,
* a value judgement,
* or a mandate to act.

It is a **diagnostic act**.

## Boundary Statement

This document supports interpretation and discussion.

It does not add requirements to the framework and must not be treated as authoritative over the constitutional phases.
