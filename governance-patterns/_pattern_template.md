# Governance Pattern: <Pattern Name>

## Pattern summary
A concise description of the governance pattern as a **class**, not an instance.

## Observed class of failure
A general description of the type of failure or degradation that can occur
when this governance condition is absent.

This must describe *what kind of failure emerges*, not how a specific system failed.

## Structural cause
The underlying governance absence or misalignment that allows this class of failure
to occur.

This section must focus on **authority, responsibility, boundaries, or enforcement** —
not technical implementation details.

## Governance requirement
What must exist for this class of failure to be structurally prevented.

Requirements should be stated normatively (e.g. “must define”, “must assign”),
not descriptively.

## Why this matters
The systemic consequences of leaving this governance condition unresolved,
especially under pressure or scale.

## Common contexts where this appears
High-level system contexts where this pattern is frequently observed
(e.g. “large regulated institutions”, “multi-team platforms”, “semi-autonomous systems”).

Do not name specific organisations, products, or incidents.

## Notes on interpretation
Optional clarifications about scope, assumptions, or limits of the interpretation.

This section may acknowledge uncertainty or alternative readings.
